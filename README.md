# Diet Meal Planning Optimization 
## Using Evolutionary Programming (EP)

### Project Overview
This project uses **Evolutionary Programming** to solve a multi-objective optimization problem: finding a daily meal plan that satisfies nutritional targets (calories) while minimizing the total cost.

### Key Features
- **Algorithm:** Evolutionary Programming (Mutation-based search).
- **Multi-Objective:** Balances Calorie accuracy and Cost efficiency.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Built with Streamlit for dynamic parameter tuning.

### How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run app: `streamlit run app.py`
